This project is a comprehensive implementation of RESTful APIs, focusing on key backend development principles such as efficient data handling, secure authentication, and clean, modular code design. 
NOTE : Developed as part of the Coursera Meta Backend Developer Professional Certificate, this project showcases the following:

1. Endpoint Design: Created and managed multiple API endpoints with well-defined routes to ensure smooth data flow and seamless integration with front-end systems.
2. CRUD Operations: Implemented full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities, ensuring reliable and efficient interactions with the database.
3. Authentication & Authorization: Integrated JWT-based authentication to secure API endpoints, providing role-based access control to sensitive data.
4. Data Validation: Applied robust input validation techniques to ensure data integrity and protect against common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and XSS attacks.
5. Error Handling: Developed comprehensive error-handling mechanisms to provide clear and informative responses to client requests, enhancing user experience and system reliability.
6. Testing: Conducted extensive unit and integration testing to validate API behavior and ensure high-quality, bug-free code.

   
This project represents my ability to develop and manage backend systems, adhering to industry standards and best practices. It demonstrates my proficiency in Python, Django (or Flask), and my understanding of RESTful API principles.
